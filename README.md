### Intro

Playlist Preserve is a minimal, focused web application designed to track and archive changes in Apple Music playlists over time, a feature Apple Music itself does not offer. Inspired by version control systems and changelogs, Playlist Preserve tracks how playlists changeâ€”day by day.

This application runs daily sync jobs to capture changes across official Apple-curated playlists. These snapshots record track additions, removals, and reorderingâ€”providing a lightweight way to observe how playlists evolve.

While the initial release targets Apple Music's Top 25 by City charts, the long-term vision includes broader support for user-generated playlists and more public curated playlists.
